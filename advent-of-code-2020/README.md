# Advent of Code 2020

My solutions for [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020).

To run these solutions you'll need to have Rust ([install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)) and [`cargo-aoc`][cargo-aoc]. Install [`cargo-aoc`][cargo-aoc]:

```
cargo install cargo-aoc
```

To run all solutions sequentially:

```
cargo run --release
```

To run a specific day or part:

```
# run the solution for day 13, part 1 and 2
cargo aoc -d 13

# run the solution for day 13, only part 2
cargo aoc -d 13 -p 2
```
