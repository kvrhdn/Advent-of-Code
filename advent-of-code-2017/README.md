# Advent of Code 2017

My solutions for [Advent of Code 2017](https://adventofcode.com/2017).

To run these solutions you'll need to have Go ([install Go](https://golang.org/doc/install)).:

To run all solutions sequentially:

```
go run . --all
```

To run a specific day or part:

```
# run the solution for day 13, part 1 and 2
go run . -d 13

# run the solution for day 13, only part 2
go run . -d 13 -p 2
```
